# RIDE-HAILING-SERVICE-USING-BIG-DATA
Ride Hailing Service is a console based program developed in c++ using DEV C++. In
the proposed system, we aimed to design an automatic-digital program which provides a
multi-user interface for the driver and passenger. The driver can find a ride in the location he
is currently in, decide which passenger he wants to pick and whether he wants to share his
location or not.
The passenger can book his ride after entering his Pickup and Drop off location ID along
with the time at which he wants to book the ride. He can then choose his car type, payment
option and whether he wants to share the ride or not. Upon successful booking, the trip, fare
and driver details will be displayed and shared with the passenger.
